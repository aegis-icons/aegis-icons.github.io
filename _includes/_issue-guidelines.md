1. App / site icon related requests has to have Aegis supported 2FA support one way or another, this project does not make icons outside of Aegis usage.
2. **Check that icon you're about to request doesn't already exist by using search on this site** or requested in the Github issues.
   - Icon packs are updated monthly, not every time a new icon is created ([see the pack releases](https://github.com/aegis-icons/aegis-icons/releases)). Icons created after the latest pack update are downloadable on this website.
3. Read the issue template and fill **at least** required parts.
4. If you have question or miscellaneous suggestion, check [FAQ](https://github.com/aegis-icons/aegis-icons/blob/master/FAQ.md) first.
5. Aegis-icons can reject any icon request for any reason, but most of the requests gets filled. Usually we do provide explanation and possibly alternative option if we reject the request.
   - Possible reasons for rejections (among others) are *too complex logo to make as monochrome or viewable in small size* ([example](https://github.com/krisu5/aegis-icons/issues/92)) and *site / app not offering Aegis supported 2FA in the first place.*
   - *Hate speech site related requests* (such as Gab, Parler, Voat etc.) will be rejected, **no exceptions.**
6. For forums we have decided to make icons based of forum software they use, because those are more universally usable for icons then specific communities. *This is judged case by case*, really popular forums can get their own icons.
   - Finding out the forum software, we are using tools such as [What CMS](https://whatcms.org) and [W3Techs Site Info](https://w3techs.com/sites).
7. Be respectful to the maintainers and contributers.

**After reading and accepting guidelines, you can now make new issue.**
