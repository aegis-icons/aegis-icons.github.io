1. App / site related requests has to have Aegis-compatible 2FA support one way or another, this project does not make icons outside of Aegis usage.
   - **Don't lie**, we always double-check if requested service has 2FA support. You can add proof for the existence of Aegis-compatible 2FA to the issue form's "Anything else?" section.
     - For the similar icons for general purpose, check out [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) instead.
2. **Check that icon you're about to request doesn't already exist by using search on this site** or opened / closed in the GitHub issues.
   - Icon packs are updated monthly, not every time a new icon is created ([see the pack releases](https://github.com/aegis-icons/aegis-icons/releases)). Icons created after the latest pack update are downloadable on this website.
3. Read the issue form **carefully** and **follow the instructions.**
4. Don't request multiple icons in single issue, make multiple issues instead.
5. Don't request **more then 5 icons at the same time.**
   - You can request more after **all** of your current requests are filled.
6. Aegis-icons can reject any icon request for any reason, but most of the requests gets filled. Usually we do provide explanation and possibly alternative option if we reject the request.
   - *Possible reasons for rejections (among others):*
     - App / site not offering Aegis supported 2FA in the first place.
     - Forum not popular enough (forum software related icon is the alternative).
     - No high quality logo resources available.
     - Too complex logo to make as monochrome or viewable in small size.
   - **[More info](#icon-acceptability-criteria)** about **approved & unapproved types of apps / sites.**
