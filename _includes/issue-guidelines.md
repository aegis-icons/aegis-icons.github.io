1. App / site icon related requests has to have Aegis supported 2FA support one way or another, this project does not make icons outside of Aegis usage.
2. Check that icon you're about to request doesn't already exist here by using search or requested in the [issues](https://github.com/krisu5/aegis-icons/issues).
3. Read the issue template and fill **at least** required parts.
4. If you have question or miscellaneous suggestion, check [FAQ](https://github.com/aegis-icons/aegis-icons/blob/master/FAQ.md) first.
5. Aegis-icons can reject any icon request for any reason, but most of the requests gets filled. Usually we do provide explanation and possibly alternative option if we reject the request.
   - Possible reasons for rejections (among others) are *too complex logo to make as monochrome or viewable in small size* ([example](https://github.com/krisu5/aegis-icons/issues/92)) and *site / app not offering Aegis supported 2FA in the first place.*
   - *Hate speech site related requests* (such as Gab, Parler, Voat etc.) will be rejected without explanation, **no exceptions.**
6. For forums we have decided to make icons based of forum software they use, because those are more universally usable for icons then specific communities. *This is judged case by case.*
   - Finding out the forum software, we are using tools such as [What CMS](https://whatcms.org) and [W3Techs Site Info](https://w3techs.com/sites).

**After reading and accepting guidelines, you can now make new issue.**
